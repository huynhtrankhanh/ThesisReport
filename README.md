# Formal Verification of Ethereum Smart Contracts with a Proof Assistant
## Motivation
### Security emanates from correctness
### Security bugs are prevalent
### Firms pay a lot to discover security bugs
### Formal verification is the way
#### Why model checkers and SMT solvers are not up to the task
#### Why using a proof assistant is the best approach
## Overview
### Foundational definitions
### Compilation process
### Syntax of new language
### Verification process
## Verified contracts
### Simple contract
### Merge sort
### Heap data structure
